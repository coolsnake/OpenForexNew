---- Blocking on WinForms : SOLVED ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----

The reason for this is the SynchronizationContext on the UI thread. It gets picked up by the WCF.

To solve it, on the implementation of your service, apply the
ServiceBehavior/CallbackBehavior attribute, setting the UseSynchronizationContext to false
