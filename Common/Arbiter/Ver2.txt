+ Allow messages to be sent trough reference locally [optinally] to increase speed. Have a thread protection mechanism for accessing them.

+ Have an advanced integrated addressing mechanism that allows complex sending operations.

+ Operation helper should be integrated with the default client and be available if case needs.

[TO BE COMPLETE WITH SOCKET SPARK MODULE]+ Provide a NON - wcf channel for communication (faster).

[COMPLETE, ICLONABLE] + Make messages be Struct [??], and have no reference members. This way they can be copied very fast.
[COMPLETE] + Make an specialized "envlope" that has the purpose to deliver the message, and remove all the transporting information from the message itself.
